# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Block Generation feature enables content creators and developers to dynamically create, customize, and manage new block types for the Payload CMS-based franchise website. This system will streamline the process of adding new content blocks to pages without requiring manual code changes, while maintaining the existing block architecture and design consistency.

## Glossary

- **Block_Generator**: The system component responsible for creating new block definitions and configurations
- **Block_Template**: A predefined structure that defines the fields, validation, and rendering logic for a block type
- **Content_Creator**: A user who creates and manages page content through the CMS interface
- **Block_Registry**: The system that maintains and manages all available block types and their configurations
- **Field_Schema**: The data structure definition that specifies the input fields and validation rules for a block
- **Render_Component**: The React component responsible for displaying a block on the frontend

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Content_Creator, I want to generate new block types through a user-friendly interface, so that I can create custom content sections without requiring developer assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Content_Creator accesses the block generation interface, THE Block_Generator SHALL display a form with block configuration options
2. WHEN a Content_Creator specifies block name and description, THE Block_Generator SHALL validate the input for uniqueness and format compliance
3. WHEN a Content_Creator defines field schemas for the block, THE Block_Generator SHALL provide field type options including text, textarea, number, checkbox, select, upload, and array
4. WHEN a Content_Creator submits a valid block configuration, THE Block_Generator SHALL create the block definition and add it to the Block_Registry
5. THE Block_Generator SHALL generate a default Render_Component template for the new block type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Content_Creator, I want to customize block field properties and validation rules, so that I can ensure content quality and consistency across the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Content_Creator configures a field in the block generator, THE Block_Generator SHALL provide options for field label, description, required status, and default values
2. WHEN a Content_Creator sets validation rules for a field, THE Block_Generator SHALL support minimum/maximum values, character limits, and format patterns
3. WHEN a Content_Creator configures select fields, THE Block_Generator SHALL allow definition of custom option lists with labels and values
4. WHEN a Content_Creator configures array fields, THE Block_Generator SHALL support nested field definitions and row limits
5. THE Block_Generator SHALL validate all field configurations before allowing block creation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Content_Creator, I want to preview generated blocks before deployment, so that I can verify the block appearance and functionality meets my requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Content_Creator completes block configuration, THE Block_Generator SHALL provide a preview mode showing the block's admin interface
2. WHEN a Content_Creator enters sample data in preview mode, THE Block_Generator SHALL render a frontend preview using the generated Render_Component
3. WHEN a Content_Creator modifies block configuration during preview, THE Block_Generator SHALL update the preview in real-time
4. THE Block_Generator SHALL display validation errors and warnings in the preview interface
5. WHEN a Content_Creator approves the preview, THE Block_Generator SHALL enable the deployment option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Content_Creator, I want to manage existing generated blocks, so that I can update, duplicate, or remove blocks as business needs evolve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Content_Creator accesses the block management interface, THE Block_Generator SHALL display a list of all generated blocks with their status and usage information
2. WHEN a Content_Creator selects a generated block for editing, THE Block_Generator SHALL load the existing configuration for modification
3. WHEN a Content_Creator duplicates a block, THE Block_Generator SHALL create a copy with a unique name and allow customization
4. WHEN a Content_Creator attempts to delete a block, THE Block_Generator SHALL check for existing usage and display appropriate warnings
5. THE Block_Generator SHALL maintain version history for generated blocks to enable rollback functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Content_Creator, I want generated blocks to integrate seamlessly with the existing CMS workflow, so that I can use them immediately in page layouts without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a block is successfully generated, THE Block_Registry SHALL automatically register the new block type in the Pages collection
2. WHEN a Content_Creator creates or edits a page, THE Block_Generator SHALL ensure generated blocks appear in the available blocks list
3. WHEN a Content_Creator adds a generated block to a page, THE Block_Generator SHALL render the block using the same styling and layout patterns as existing blocks
4. THE Block_Generator SHALL ensure generated blocks support the published/unpublished toggle functionality
5. WHEN a generated block is used on a page, THE Block_Generator SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing page rendering system
