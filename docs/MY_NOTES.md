1. 3. Sponsored Featured Business

- Dedicated featured sponsor block (single card or small carousel).
- “Sponsored” badge and a Learn More CTA (can route to the sponsor’s detail page or an external link).
- This sits immediately after the Hero to honor sponsorship prominence.

1. 4. Featured Franchises

- Uses standardized shadcn components for cards/badges and visual consistency.

1. 5. Top Picks

1. 10. Footer

  Notes and guidance:

- Featured Franchises should be positioned after the Sponsored Featured Business and before Top Picks for a clear content hierarchy.
- Filters stay on the dedicated Franchises page (/franchises) as you requested; the homepage should only preview curated groups.
- Ensure headings follow accessible hierarchy: one H1 in the Hero, then H2s for each section below.
- Keep CTAs consistent and visible: Assessment in the Hero; Speak to a Consultant Now accessible from both Hero and Top Picks.
- Maintain brand consistency with the provided colors (#004AAD and #2C8939) for buttons and badges.
