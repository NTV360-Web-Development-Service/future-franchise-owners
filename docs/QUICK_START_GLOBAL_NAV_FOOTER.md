# Quick Start: Global Navbar & Footer

## What Changed?

✅ Created a **Site Settings** global in Payload CMS
✅ Navbar and Footer are now managed globally (one place, site-wide)
✅ Automatically rendered on all pages - no need to add them manually

## How to Use

### Step 1: Configure in Payload CMS

1. Open your Payload Admin Panel
2. In the sidebar, click **Globals** → **Site Settings**
3. You'll see 3 tabs:

**Navbar Tab:**

- **Toggle**: Check/uncheck "Published" in sidebar to show/hide globally
- Upload logo or set logo text
- Add navigation links
- Configure CTA button

**Footer Tab:**

- **Toggle**: Check/uncheck "Published" in sidebar to show/hide globally
- Set company info and tagline
- Add social media links
- Create footer columns with links
- Add bottom links (Privacy, Terms, etc.)
- Customize colors

**General Tab:**

- Site name and description
- Contact information

### Step 2: Save and Done!

Hit **Save** and visit any page on your site. The navbar and footer will automatically appear on ALL pages.

## Global Toggle Available!

You can now toggle navbar and footer globally:

### To Hide Navbar Globally:

1. Go to **Globals → Site Settings → Navbar** tab
2. In the sidebar, **uncheck** "Published"
3. Save - navbar will disappear from all pages

### To Hide Footer Globally:

1. Go to **Globals → Site Settings → Footer** tab
2. In the sidebar, **uncheck** "Published"
3. Save - footer will disappear from all pages

**Your configuration is saved!** When you check the boxes again, everything comes back exactly as it was.

### Use Cases for Toggling:

- **Maintenance**: Hide navbar/footer temporarily while updating
- **Landing Pages**: Create a special site-wide experience without nav/footer
- **Testing**: Quickly see your site without navigation elements
- **Special Events**: Create an immersive full-screen experience
