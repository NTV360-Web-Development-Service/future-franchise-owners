# Contact Blocks Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented two new contact-related blocks for the Payload CMS block system:

1. **Contact Form Block** - A flexible form for visitor inquiries
2. **Contact Info Block** - Display business contact details with optional map

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Block Definitions (Pages Collection)

**File:** `src/collections/Pages.tsx`

Added two new block types to the Pages collection:

#### Contact Form Block (`contactForm`)

- Published toggle (default: true)
- Heading and description fields
- Submit button text customization
- Success message customization
- Flexible form fields configuration:
  - Name (show/required toggles)
  - Email (show/required toggles)
  - Phone (show/required toggles)
  - Company (show/required toggles)
  - Subject (show/required toggles)
  - Message (show/required toggles)

#### Contact Info Block (`contactInfo`)

- Published toggle (default: true)
- Heading field
- Contact details configuration:
  - Phone (show toggle + value)
  - Email (show toggle + value)
  - Address (show toggle + value with line breaks)
  - Business hours (show toggle + value with line breaks)
- Optional map integration:
  - Show map toggle
  - Map URL (Google Maps embed)
  - Map height (200-600px)

### 2. React Components

#### ContactFormBlock Component

**File:** `src/components/blocks/ContactFormBlock.tsx`

Features:

- Client-side form validation
- Email format validation with regex
- Conditional field rendering based on CMS configuration
- Loading states during submission
- Success/error message display
- Full accessibility support (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Uses shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Label, Textarea)

#### ContactInfoBlock Component

**File:** `src/components/blocks/ContactInfoBlock.tsx`

Features:

- Conditional rendering of contact details
- Clickable phone links (tel: protocol)
- Clickable email links (mailto: protocol)
- Formatted address with line breaks
- Business hours display
- Optional embedded map
- Lucide React icons for visual enhancement
- Responsive grid layout

### 3. UI Components

#### Textarea Component

**File:** `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`

Created a new Textarea component following the shadcn/ui pattern to support the message field in the contact form.

### 4. API Route Enhancement

**File:** `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`

Enhanced the existing contact API to:

- Accept additional fields: phone, company, subject
- Extract visitor IP address from request headers
- Store submissions in the `contactSubmissions` collection
- Return submission ID in response
- Maintain existing webhook/email routing logic
- Add error handling for database operations

### 5. Block Registration

#### Block Exports

**File:** `src/components/blocks/index.ts`

Added exports for the new contact blocks.

#### Page Rendering

**Files:**

- `src/app/(frontend)/[slug]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(frontend)/page.tsx`

Added block type mappings in the `renderBlock` function to support:

- `contactForm` → ContactFormBlock
- `contactInfo` → ContactInfoBlock

### 6. Type Generation

Regenerated Payload CMS types to include the new blocks and collection:

```bash
pnpm payload generate:types
```

## Database Schema

The `contactSubmissions` collection (already created) stores:

- name (optional)
- email (optional)
- phone (optional)
- company (optional)
- subject (optional)
- message (optional)
- ipAddress (captured automatically)
- status (new/read/archived)
- timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

## Usage in CMS

Content editors can now:

1. **Add Contact Form Block:**
   - Navigate to any page in the CMS
   - Add a "Contact Form" block
   - Configure which fields to show/require
   - Customize heading, description, button text, and success message
   - Toggle published status

2. **Add Contact Info Block:**
   - Navigate to any page in the CMS
   - Add a "Contact Info" block
   - Configure which contact details to display
   - Optionally add an embedded map
   - Toggle published status

3. **View Submissions:**
   - Access "Contact Submissions" collection in admin panel
   - View all form submissions in reverse chronological order
   - Mark submissions as read or archived
   - See visitor IP addresses for security

## Technical Details

### Form Validation

- Client-side validation before submission

- Real-time error clearing on user input

### Accessibility

### Styling

- Consistent with existing block patterns
